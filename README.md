## About
### An SMCP language learning application
Standard Marine Communication Phrases, referred to as SMCP, are a crucial part of communication at Sea. That's why the International Maritime Organization(IMO) has made it mandatory according to the IMO convention for all officers in management and operational positions onboard to be ‘conversant with SMCP’ at different levels.
### Chalmers University of Technology
Chalmers University of Technology has a long tradition of teaching in Shipping and Maritime technology. As such, teaching SMCP to its students has been a key focus. The University was looking for a new, modern and engaging language learning application to replace an old application to teach SMCP to its students. A proposal was made by the University for students to develop such an application as part of their bachelor thesis. 

As a result, SailorSpeak was created in the spring of 2023 by the students Mirco Ghadri and Zakariya Omar as part of their bachelor thesis in computer science.

## Getting Started
### Branches

#### Flutterflow
The flutterflow branch contains the code of the application that is on flutterflow. This is not the code of the final application. The reason is that some manual code additions could not be done inside flutterflow due to limitations in the low-code builder. Hence, they were done outside of flutterflow using visual studio code. The flutterflow project can be accessed at https://app.flutterflow.io/project/sailor-speak-hh884k.

#### Main
The main branch contains the final application, with the manual code additions. These manual code additions were necessary since they could not be done inside of flutterflow. This includes voice recording functionality and custom logic.

#### Web
This is the application compiled for web using the command `flutter build web`. The application can be run on https://ksedix.github.io/SailorSpeak/.
